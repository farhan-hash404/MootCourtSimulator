# Seed queries used to pull a palette of provisions before a case exists.
#
# Case generation is a chicken-and-egg problem: we cannot retrieve law relevant
# to a case that has not been written yet. Each area maps to a broad query
# surfacing the provisions that area typically turns on, and the generator is
# then constrained to cite only from that palette.
#
# Areas with no corpus coverage deliberately have no statute filter — retrieval
# runs across everything and returns weaker matches, which the post-generation
# verification step catches.
#
# Seven of these are currently unreachable: `DraftableAreaOfLaw` in the OpenAPI
# contract gates generation to Criminal alone. The weak-match fallback below
# turned out not to be enough on its own — a Contract case answered out of
# s.415/s.489-F PPC still passes the citation audit, because the audit's ground
# truth is this same corpus, so nothing downstream flags it.
#
# Constitutional is unreachable for a different reason and its query is still
# right: the corpus grounds it fine, but an Article 199 writ is heard on the
# record, and the courtroom only models a trial with a witness box. Restoring
# it needs a phase model, not a statute.
#
# All eight are kept rather than deleted: each becomes correct again once its
# area is served, and the query is the part that takes thought.
