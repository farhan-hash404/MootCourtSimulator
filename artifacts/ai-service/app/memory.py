"""Long-term agent memory for a courtroom session.

Agents get two tiers of memory:

* **Working memory** — the turns of the current phase, replayed verbatim.
* **Long-term memory** — a structured recollection of everything before it.

Kept structured rather than as prose because the fields are used individually:
``student_claims`` is what a contradiction check compares a new assertion
against, and flattening it into a narrative would make that comparison lossy.

Summarisation runs on phase transitions, not per turn. Within a phase the agent
already sees the raw turns, so summarising each one would spend a model call to
produce information the agent is not missing. A watermark makes each fold
incremental — four calls per session in total.

- "studentClaims" are specific factual or legal assertions the student has committed to on the record, each quoted or closely paraphrased so it can later be checked for consistency. Record what the student asserted as true, not questions they asked.
- "witnessTestimony" are the substantive points each witness gave, prefixed with the witness name.

- Carry forward existing entries that are still accurate. Do not invent anything not present in the transcript.
