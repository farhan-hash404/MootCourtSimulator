"""Grounded generation of moot-court practice cases.

Reasoning lives in this service, so case generation lives here rather than in the
Express route it was moved out of. Express keeps validation and persistence and
calls across for the model work — the same split verdict scoring already uses.

A generated case now carries a structured brief (facts, grounds, prayer) rather
than a single summary paragraph, because grounds are what a student actually
argues and prayer is what they ask the bench for. That brief is also read by the
courtroom agents, which is why every list here is capped: the brief is rendered
into `AgentContext.case_context()` and therefore rides in every agent prompt.

Grounds are prose that *contains citations*, so they are audited the same way
`applicableLaws` always has been. Constraining the prompt to a retrieved palette
reduces fabrication; it does not eliminate it, and a student must never be shown
a section number the corpus could not confirm.

AVAILABLE PROVISIONS:

Rules for citations, in "applicableLaws" and inside every ground:
- Cite ONLY from this exact list: {"; ".join(allowed)}
- Reproduce each citation string exactly as written above.
- Cite 2-4 provisions that the dispute actually turns on. Do not pad the list.
- Never invent a section or article number that does not appear above.

Draft the case as a filing would be drafted:
- "facts" are the numbered factual averments, in chronological order, each one sentence or two. They tell the story; they do not argue it.
- "grounds" are the legal propositions the case stands on. Each ground must state a proposition of law and name the provision it rests on, drawn only from the list above. This is the argument the student will have to defend.
- "prayer" is the specific relief sought from the court, itemised. Each item is something a court could actually order.
