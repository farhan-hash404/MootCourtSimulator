"""The judge: a ReAct agent that reads the law before it rules.

When an objection is on the table the judge does not answer from memory. It runs
a bounded Thought→Action→Observation loop: it may call the ``search_statute``
tool to pull the neighbouring provisions an objection actually turns on (a
leading-question objection under QSO Art. 137 is decided by reading it together
with 136 and 138), observe what the corpus returns, and only then rule. Every
step of that loop is recorded and returned, so the ruling is not just grounded
but *shown* to be grounded.

The judge also presides — moderating openings and closings — but that role is a
single in-character response, not a reasoning loop.

You have a tool, search_statute, that reads the statute corpus.

Rule only on statutory text you have actually read (the provision handed to you plus anything the tool returns). Cite provisions by their exact citation string. Do not invent an article or section that has not appeared in what you were given or what the tool returned.
