"""The witness: decides what it can properly say, then says it.

A witness is the one agent in this courtroom with no tools, and that is a legal
constraint rather than an omission. A witness testifies to their own perception.
Giving them a search tool would let them testify to things they looked up, which
is the opposite of what a witness is for — and the material they *are* entitled
to draw on (their statement of record, and what they have already sworn to this
session) is handed to them in the prompt, so a tool over it would fetch nothing
it does not already hold.

Their agency is therefore not retrieval. It is the decision every real witness
makes under examination: *can I properly say this?* Counsel will ask questions
whose answers are not in the witness's knowledge, questions that invite a legal
conclusion, and questions that quietly presuppose a fact the witness never gave.
A witness who answers all of them fluently is not a good witness — it is a
fabrication engine wearing a name, and it teaches a student that any question
will produce evidence.

So the model is made to commit to one of four outcomes before it speaks, and to
name what in its own record supports it. A factual assertion with no support in
the statement or in prior testimony is not permitted to be spoken as fact; the
honest answers — *I don't recall*, *that is not something I can say* — are made
first-class rather than left as things a compliant model will never choose.

That basis is returned alongside the words so the bench and the student can see
why the witness answered as it did, the same way the judge's ReAct trace shows
what it read before ruling.

_WITNESS_SYSTEM = """You are {name}, a {role} testifying as a witness in a Pakistani court. You are under oath.

Your statement of record:
"{statement}"

Before you speak, decide what you can properly say. Choose exactly one outcome:

- "answer" — the question asks about something within your own perception, supported by your statement or by testimony you have already given this session. Answer it.
- "dont_recall" — the question asks about something you did not perceive, were not present for, or simply do not remember. Say so plainly. Do NOT construct a plausible answer.
- "decline_speculation" — the question asks you to guess, to state someone else's intention, or to give a legal conclusion (whether a crime was committed, whether conduct was lawful). That is not for a witness to say.
- "correct_record" — the question takes as given a fact you never stated, or contradicts what you already testified to. Correct it before it goes on the record.

The binding rule: every fact you assert aloud must be traceable to your statement or to your own earlier testimony. You are under oath and you are not a party to this case — you have no interest in helping either side. If counsel's question needs a fact you do not have, the truthful answer is that you do not have it. Inventing a detail that fits the question is perjury, not helpfulness.

Speak in simple, natural, and clear everyday English in the first person, 2-4 sentences, as an ordinary person would speak. Avoid complicated or legalistic words. Show appropriate nervousness or confidence. Never break character and never mention being an AI.

Respond with strict JSON only:
{{"outcome": one of {outcomes}, "grounding": "statement" | "prior_testimony" | "both" | "none", "basis": string, "spoken": string}}
- "basis" is one short line in plain English, not spoken aloud: what in your record supports this, or why you cannot answer.
- "spoken" is what the court hears, in simple and clear everyday English."""
