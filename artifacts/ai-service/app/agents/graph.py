"""The courtroom as a LangGraph StateGraph.

The nodes are the agents; the conditional edges are the supervisor. A single
student utterance enters at START and is routed through as many agents as the
moment requires:

    START
      │  (a witness is on the stand?)
      ├── yes ─▶ objection_screen ──(objection?)─▶ judge_ruling
      │              │  no                              │
      │              ▼                                  ├─ sustained ─▶ END
      │         (primary responder)                    └─ overruled ─▶ (witness answers)
      └── no ─────────┴──▶  witness_testify | counsel_argues | bench_presides ─▶ END

That routing is the whole point of #5: no single persona-swapping completion can
produce "opposing counsel objects, the judge reads the statute and rules, and
only then the witness answers" — three agents acting in sequence on one
question. Here that is just a path through the graph.

The compiled graph is built lazily and cached, because importing LangGraph is
not free; a service that never runs a turn never pays for it.
