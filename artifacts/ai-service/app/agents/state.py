"""Shared state, request models and event types for the multi-agent courtroom.

The courtroom is modelled as a LangGraph ``StateGraph``: each agent — opposing
counsel, the judge, a witness — is a node, and the supervisor is the set of
conditional edges that route a single student utterance through however many
agents need to act on it. One spoken turn by the student can therefore produce
a *sequence* of AI responses (an objection, a ruling, then an answer), which is
what a real moot court sounds like and what a single persona-swapping
completion could never produce.

Everything that crosses the wire is camelCase to match the OpenAPI contract the
Node API and web app are generated from; internal fields stay snake_case.
