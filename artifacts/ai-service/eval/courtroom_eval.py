"""Courtroom evaluation: does opposing counsel object correctly, and rule right?

The judge eval measures the *grader*. This measures the *courtroom* — the two
decisions the multi-agent graph makes that a student actually experiences:

* **Does counsel object when it should, and stay silent when it should not?**
  Both halves matter. An advocate who never objects is scenery; one who objects
  to every question is noise. Reported as precision/recall over the objection
  decision, with the proper-question controls carrying the false-positive rate.
* **Does the bench rule correctly on what was raised?** A leading question in
  examination-in-chief should be sustained; the same question in
  cross-examination is permitted and should not draw an objection at all.

Ground scoring credits any ground in ``expectedGrounds`` rather than one right
answer, because more than one ground is genuinely defensible for the same
question — a foundationless character attack is both insulting and irrelevant.
Scoring a defensible choice as wrong would understate the agent and push future
work towards gaming a single label.

This drives ``run_turn`` — the same entry point the API calls — so the harness
cannot drift from the product.
