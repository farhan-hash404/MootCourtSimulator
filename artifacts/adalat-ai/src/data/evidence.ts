Those checkpoints are trained on web-search pairs and have no representation of legal doctrine, so the whole corpus is out of distribution. Out-of-domain reranking is worse than none.",

The audit sees a citation absent from the corpus; it cannot tell relying on one from refusing one. Anything shown to a student now uses the attributed field instead.",

The ingest decided whether to re-embed from whether an embedding existed and which model made it — never from whether the wording had changed — so the corrected provision kept the vector of the definition repealed in 2016. It now records a hash of the exact text embedded and re-embeds when that moves. Fixing the words is not fixing the index.",

Every guard in the system passed it, because the audit checks that a citation exists in the corpus and the corpus was its own ground truth. An internally consistent corpus that disagrees with the statute book is invisible to citation auditing — which is why the text is being verified provision by provision.",

The single exception is Constitution Art. 199 — the article every writ petition is filed under. It is not flagged because the text disagrees with the source but because it is later than it: it refers to the Federal Constitutional Court and to clause (1A) barring suo motu action, neither of which appears in the National Assembly print of 28 February 2012, so that print cannot confirm it. It carries a per-provision flag with a note saying exactly that, and nothing in the app presents it as authoritative law. Verification is per provision rather than per file, so one unconfirmed article neither hides behind its seven verified neighbours nor drags them down with it. Six numbering errors were found on the way, including an objection ground that cited Art. 143 for a rule that lives in Art. 148.",
