"""Diff the statute corpus against an official source document.

Corpus provisions in ``data/statutes/*.json`` were written from model knowledge
and originally all carried ``"verified": false``; 52 of the 53 have since been
read against an official source and flipped by hand. Flipping that flag is a
legal judgement, so this tool deliberately **never writes it** — it only puts
the corpus text and the official text side by side, with the substantive
word-level differences marked, so a human can make the call in seconds instead
of minutes.

The flag is per provision (``sections[i].verified``), falling back to the
instrument-level ``verified`` for provisions that do not set one. Mark the ones
that matched; a provision still under review keeps the ⚠ without taking the rest
of its instrument down with it.

The expensive part of verification is not the decision, it is finding the
passage and spotting a dropped clause in a wall of statutory prose. That is the
part this automates.

    python scripts/verify-statutes.py constitution-1973 --source <official.pdf>
    python scripts/verify-statutes.py constitution-1973 --source <official.txt>
    python scripts/verify-statutes.py --list

Structural noise is ignored on purpose. The corpus stores one flowing paragraph
per provision while the official text numbers its clauses "(1) … (2)(a) …", so a
raw diff is almost entirely "(1)", "(a)", "—" and tells you nothing. Those
markers are stripped before comparison; what survives is words the two texts
genuinely disagree about, which is where a dropped limb or a changed threshold
shows up.

Requires PyMuPDF (``fitz``) or ``pypdf`` only when --source is a PDF.
