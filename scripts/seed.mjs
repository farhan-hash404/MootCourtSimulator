 * `applicableLaws` is derived from resolved pairs and cannot lie. A brief

 * pleaded proposition of law and is fed to every agent through
 * `case_context()`. Nothing downstream would catch it — the runtime audit runs
 * over what agents *say*, not over what the case file already asserted.
 *
 * So every citation written in a brief must be spelled the way the corpus
 * renders one ("QSO 1984 Art. 141", "PPC 1860 s.302"), and every one of them
 * must resolve. The pattern is built from the corpus's own prefixes rather than
 * from a second alias table, so it cannot drift from the statute book.
 *
 * What this does not catch: a citation written in a looser form the Python
 * extractor would still read, such as "Article 999 of the QSO". That is the
 * price of not reimplementing `app/rag/citations.py` here in a second language.
 * House rendering in brief prose is the convention that makes the check bite.
